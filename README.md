In this lab session, we created and set up a new GitHub account . The session began with a walkthrough of the GitHub registration process at github.com, where I chose a username, set a secure password, and verified my email address.
Once signed in, I customized their profiles and was introduced to the GitHub dashboard. The instructor provided instructions on how to create a new repository, add a README file, and make the initial commit. I also learned basic GitHub vocabulary such as repository, commit, branch, and push.
By the end of the session, I had an active GitHub account and had practiced creating and navigating repositories, laying the foundation for future version control and collaborative coding assignments.
